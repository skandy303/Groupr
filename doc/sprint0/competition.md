**Possible Competitors:** 

Google Classroom: https: //classroom.google.com/ 
Canvas: https: //www.canvas.net/ 

Both websites, like our product, are classroom management tools that allow professors to create assignments to be viewed by students. These assignments can include group projects and students can be sorted into groups for these assignments much like our product. 

**How Is Our Product Different?** 

Our product differs from our competitors by providing a tool for students to form groups more easily for assignments regardless of how many other students they know within their class. It accomplishes this through our matching feature that allows students to swipe through and view the profiles of their classmates. Based on these profiles the user can “like” certain classmates based on which ones they believe they would fit well within a group. When two users mutually “like” each other they match and then can agree to form a group together. 

**What User/Scenarios Is Our Product Better For?** 

Our product allows these students to view information about their classmates before forming groups with them allowing them to judge whether they fit well within a group even if they don't personally know the other student. This makes our product perfect for professors who want to make the process of forming groups easier on their students and for students taking classes where they don’t know many of their classmates.  

**Why did these competitors not focus on these users and/or scenarios? And what would it take from them to do so?** 

A potential reason that Google Classroom and Canvas lack a built-in matching feature is that they were created with the social aspect of a classroom in mind. The goal of these products is to be a tool for professors to create and manage assignments and while this includes group assignments the intention is for the forming of these groups to be done by the students by interacting with their classmates.
