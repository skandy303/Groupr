## Process
### Meeting Procedure & Frequency
In general, the procedure for our meetings involved posting an agenda beforehand that outlined what we would do during the meeting. Then we would join a Discord voice call. We would typically use some sort of collaborative tool such as Google docs or a collaborative whiteboard such as Miro to discuss ideas.  After meetings we would post a list of action items that needed to be completed as well as an agenda for the next meeting. We heavily relied on Discord to organize ourselves and all the documents we were sharing.

We typically met twice every weekend and at least once throughout the week. Each meeting would last 1-2 hours.
### Story Points
We had one technically experienced group member work on assigning story points. After that, we all met to review his suggestions and rationale. We voted on the stories using Planning Poker after we discussed what the stories would technically involve. We finalized the story points based on the outcome of Planning Poker.
### Decision making
Whenever a decision had to be made, we would share our thoughts and offer feedback on the course of action. In order for a decision to be finalized, critical feedback against it would need to be sufficiently addressed. This was enough for us to be on the same page and make effective decisions. Occasionally for certain issues we used majority votes such as what product we wanted to build. We will continue to use these approaches in the future.
### Team Organization
Aydin Parkeh is our product owner. 
Our team will do fullstack with focus as follows:
Frontend: Ben, Mohammad, Tina
Backend: Aydin, Howard, Pedram, Skandan, 

### Next Steps
Since everyone is getting busier with the semester, we need to leverage async work and feedback processes further so that we can accomplish more without needing frequent long meetings. 


After prioritizing stories our next focus is to develop API contracts and divide up feature development so that we can split up and work on features in smaller groups then come together to integrate together.
