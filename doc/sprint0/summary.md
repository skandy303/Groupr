## Summary
### Objective
Build a web application that facilitates finding a group for group projects in a classroom setting. The application will allow professors to set up projects and for students to enter bios that they can then use to determine if other students will be suitable group members for their group. Students will be able to browse other students and groups to form suitable groups. Once they've formed a group their contact information will be shared with each other to move forward with their project.

### Key Personas:
The application is being designed to meet the needs of personas such as George and Leo.

George is a professor with 20 years of teaching experience and has always taught courses that involved group projects. He believes that learning to work well together effectively will make his students better members of society. However he has always perceived that forming groups in a class is challenging; people who have no friends or pre-formed group in the class often struggle to form a functional group.

Leo is the type of student that George is concerned for. He has participated in courses where he knew no one and as such struggled to form a group. Even when he did form a group, it would be done without any information on the skill-sets of his group members and he would often end up in groups where he ended up doing all the work because his group members were not motivated to work hard.

Personas such as George will be able to use our app to help people like Leo form groups that can work together effectively.

### Key Scenarios:
George is teaching a software engineering course that requires people to form groups that have a wide array of skill-sets. Groups will need members who specialize in frontend, backend and deployment technologies. George knows that the conventional approach of leaving group making to students will be difficult as students without connections will struggle to find a group with evenly distributed skill sets. George can use our app where students will be able to share their skill-sets and interests so that they can form a group with the appropriate skills for the project.

Leo is taking a computer science ethics course that requires finding a debate partner and debating an ethical topic of interest as a culminating project. Leo does not know anyone in the course and is taking the course remotely due to Covid. He wants to discuss the ethics surrounding autonomous cars and accidents. He hopes to find a group partner who is as passionate as him about this subject and has a similar schedule. If Leoâ€™s professor was to use our app then Leo could communicate his interests through his bio and match with someone who had a similar schedule.

### Key Principles:
Simple & Intuitive: Product features, mechanics and design should be simple to understand and intuitive to use from the customers perspective. We want to avoid overwhelming the customer and instead aim to delight them.

Ownership & Initiative: Own the product and your code. If you think something can be done in a better way then take the initiative to show us how. The customer will always benefit from us taking ownership and showing initiative to improve our ideas and processes.
