# SR1

### Summary

Sprint retrospective for sprint 1 was held on October 10 2022. All team members were present and participated in the meeting. 

### Good Practices

Team members commented that the following practices were fruitful in the last sprint:

- Front-end pages were broken up into components
- API calls on front-end were separated from component logic
- React query was leveraged to handle API call state
- Back-end leveraged serializers appropriately to handle responses
- Back-end errors were informative

### Bad Practices

Team members commented on the following bad practices that need to be improved on.

- Front-end needs to determine a scalable method to add styling. Right now the styling is bare. We agreed that we would research styling options this sprint and try to implement in the next sprint.
- Back-end incorrectly wrote the API endpoint path in their API contract sometimes which caused confusion. We agreed that we will be more careful about this.
- There was no clear communication about character limits as accepted by front-end and back-end; we agreed that we will communicate these requirements clearly so as to avoid bugs.
