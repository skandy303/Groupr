## Describe your changes

## Checklist before requesting a review

- [ ] I tested my code
- [ ] I reviewed the diff
- [ ] (Frontend) I ran `npm run format` and `npm run lint`, my changes pass linting and introduce no new warnings.
- [ ] (Backend) I formatted with `black` and `isort`
- [ ] I updated the [CRC cards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVMXZsxNIBQx_QdY1SpmGEJ37tTsgLJSSC__ORrG6RI/edit?usp=sharing) 

Note: For CRC Cards ensure that collaboration is symmetric, if X collaborates with Y then Y collaborates with X (you must change both CRC Cards).
